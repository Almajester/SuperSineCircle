# SuperSineCircle

A Processing/Java application that shows sinusoidal motion of disks in a unit circle.  Initially just two disks, one horizontal and one vertical, but the number and angles can be changed via the + and - keys.  This is based on a demo from a Numberphile video.  HSB colorspace interpolates over the disks' positions between center and edge.
